# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Syl! (she/her)

## I'm a Front End Web Developer, a professional hobby dabbler, a gamer, an avid potter and a proud plant mom. 

I recently shifted careers from internal operations and the culinary industry due to Covid-19. I've always been surrounded by devs (friends and colleagues) and interested in learning but never made the time to do so. Getting laid off during Covid-19 gave me the time I needed to finally take the leap and learn. I am currently a student at Juno College, and wrapping up the web dev bootcamp (cohort 30). I'm excited to make a positive impact on the world, one line of code at a time! 

 ### :computer: I'm currently working on:
  - My React skills
  - My personal portfolio!
  - A POE app to help organize your new build every season (where to get items and at what level)
 
 ### :books:I'm currently learning: 
 - Redux
 - Vanilla JS
 
 <h3> :sparkles: In 2021 I want to learn: </h3>
 - Python
 - Vue.js
 
 ###  :speech_balloon: Ask me about: Plants!
 - I have over 60 thriving plants at home, big and small.
 - I can help you find out why your plant babies aren't doing so well, or help guide you for your next purchase. 
 
  ### :video_game: I enjoy playing:
  - Diablo 3
  - Path Of Exile
  - Anything Zelda!
  - Animal Crossing 
  - Mario Kart
