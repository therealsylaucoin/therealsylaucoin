# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Syl! (she/her)

## I'm a Front End Web Developer, a professional hobby dabbler, a gamer, an avid potter and a proud plant mom. 

I recently shifted careers from internal operations and the culinary industry due to Covid-19. I've always been surrounded by devs (friends and colleagues) and interested in learning but never made the time to do so. Getting laid off during Covid-19 gave me the time I needed to finally take the leap and learn. I recently completed the Web Develoment Immersive Bootcamp at Juno College. I'm excited to make a positive impact on the world, one line of code at a time! 

## My skillset includes:
